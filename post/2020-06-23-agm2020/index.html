    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The Dolphins Hall Management Committee AGM would typically be held sometime between April and June. The public at the AGM would elect six resident trustees to serve until the next AGM, and the trustees present the accounts to those present.</p>
<p>At last years AGM there were nearly one hundred people.  Current social distancing rules make holding a meeting of this size impractical. Also, traditional paper-based secret ballots are quite high contact events, which is far from desirable at this time.</p>
<p>Once we get late into the year, an AGM will become less meaningful as any trustees elected would still only be able to serve until the next AGM next spring.</p>
<p>After extensive discussion with the charity commission and reviewing the charity guidelines, the trustees have decided that there will be no AGM in 2020. The current trustees will serve until the next AGM in 2021.</p>
<p>In the absence of an AGM over the next few weeks, the trust will put out an annual report for 2019/20 online and present the annual accounts in the same way.  We will welcome any questions the public might have about either of them or any other subject concerning the trust.</p>
<p>The trustees will seek to be in a position to present the trusts accounts for 2020/21, and therefore hold an AGM,  as quickly as possible after the trust&rsquo;s year-end on 31st March 2021.</p>
<p>The situation is far from ideal, but in these unprecedented times, difficult decisions are having to become the norm.</p>
<p>Hopefully, in the next few months, we will be able to re-open the hall and sport will return to the recreation ground.  This week we received eighty pages of documentation on the procedures we need to follow to allow the public back in. It is going to take us a little while to digest them and put all the required safety requirements in place.</p>
<p>We want to thank the people of Tetbury for their fantastic support at this time, and we look forward to being able to offer a service closer to normal as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Dolphins Recreation Centre.</p>
