      <title>Sadly Not There Yet</title>

      <description>Despite the lights shining out around Tetbury as the community embraces the call for a Christmas lights trail, it has not been a period of Christmas cheer for the trustees of the Dolphins Recreation Centre.
On 23rd October 2020, TTC confirmed one of the S106 contracts awarded to us by CDC would be released, with the remaining two to be voted on within a week. 56 days later, no funds have materialised and despite our requests, this wasn’t even an agenda item at the Council meeting on Monday 14th December.</description>

      <description>As you know on Thursday evening, the Dolphins Recreation Centre (DRC) and Tetbury Town Council (TTC) held two small face-to-face meetings arranged by the Chair of the Redevelopment Project in an attempt to move discussions forward and put them on a more positive footing to hopefully see the S106 funding released.
Both parties have agreed to keep the contents of the discussions private, however at the meeting TTC did ask for a correction to the leaflet recently produced by DRC which was funded and distributed by a small number of our supporters also hoping to see the project start ASAP.</description>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-10-07-announcement/</guid>
      <description>In light of the recent accusations in the latest post on Tetbury Town Councils Facebook Page, we would like to say we take every complaint of bullying and inappropriate behaviour seriously and will investigate and take suitable action to correct any wrongs that have been done.
However, to date, we have not received an official complaint from any members of Tetbury Town Council and their public statement is, in fact, the first time we have heard about it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to cancel the Redevelopment Project because Tetbury Town Council continues to refuse to release our allocated S106 funds, we have set up a petition urging TTC to release the funds to the project. This is your chance to help us and show them your support for the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROJECT CANCELLED&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…are not words we will say lightly, but may just be the ones we are forced to say if Tetbury Town Council (TTC) continue in the manner they are currently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Playground Equipment</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-09-24-new-playground-equipment/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-09-24-new-playground-equipment/</guid>
      <description>This week we have seen the installation of the new playground equipment completed and it’s looking great!
At a cost of over £4,000 it is a significant investment for us and one we couldn’t have made without the £1,500 kindly donated by Tetbury Lions and which are extremely thankful for.
The playground is a key part of the facility for us, but it a costly one to upkeep and one which the original maintenance plans agreed at installation have been long forgotten.</description>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-08-26-planning/</guid>
      <description>Wow, a great week continues! The Dolphins Recreation Centre are delighted to confirm today we received confirmation from Cotswold District Council that they are supportive of the Redevelopment Project and have approved our planning application in full! This has been a long road for the trustees and marks another significant milestone for the progress of the project. In particular, we would like to thank each and every one of you who have supported us in this journey and especially all of you who went out of your way to register your support of the planning application officially.</description>

      <title>A Sneak Peek at Community, Youth &amp; Sports Complex</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-08-18-sneak-peek/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-08-18-sneak-peek/</guid>
      <description>We thought you may all like a sneak peek at some of the images of a model based on the design of the new Community, Youth &amp;amp; Sports Complex which we&amp;rsquo;ve received from the architects recently as it certainly made us excited and gave us a boost following all the recent drama around the project!
While we still wait for the release of the S106 monies for the project, we&amp;rsquo;re continuing to take the project seriously and getting ready to start the build as soon as planning permission is received.</description>

      <title>Release of S106 Funds - We are Making Some Progress</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-08-03-some-progress/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-08-03-some-progress/</guid>
      <description>We want to thank our District Councillors, Stephen Hirst, Nikki Ind and Richard Norris for organising a meeting today between representatives from the Dolphins Recreation Centre (DRC), Cotswold District Council (CDC) Planning, CDC Legal and Tetbury Town Council (the Mayor and the Town Clerk).
The purpose of the meeting was to examine some of the Town Council&amp;rsquo;s concerns over their individual liability and S106 compliance in respect of Project One of the DRC Redevelopment Project.</description>

      <title>Release of S106 Funds Declined by TTC</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-07-27-s106-refused/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-07-27-s106-refused/</guid>
      <description>We had high hopes for today as today was the day when Tetbury Town Council were going to agree to the forwarding of the S106 funding to the Redevelopment Project following the recommendation from their own Finance &amp;amp; Scrutiny Committee to do just that.
We are very sad however that tonight Tetbury Town Council refused to release the S106 monies assigned to the new Dolphins Redevelopment Project and yet again, the possibility of new community facilities from Tetbury takes another step back.</description>

      <title>More Good News and a little bit of Progress.</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-07-13-progress/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-07-13-progress/</guid>
      <description>So this evening we have some more good news to share.
Tonight Tetbury Town Council planning committee took the opportunity to once again review the plans for the Redevelopment Project and voted unanimously to withdraw their objection and now support the project. This means all statutory bodies now support the project and we await final sign off from Cotswold District Council which is due by the end of the month.</description>

      <title>Good News For The Rec</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-07-10-good-news-for-the-rec/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-07-10-good-news-for-the-rec/</guid>
      <description>Even in lockdown it has been a busy time for trustees as we not only continue work on the Redevelopment Project, but we look at other ways of delivering on our commitment to the people of Tetbury to make the facilities the best they can be.
After years of neglect, we started work last year on improving the upkeep and maintenance of the Recreation Ground. The eagle eyed among you will have noticed the work we started last week to improve the facilities enjoyed by everyone out on the Recreation Ground.</description>

      <title>Proposed Redevelopment Project Update</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-06-25-project-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-06-25-project-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given another inaccurate public announcement in respect of the project by a relation to two True to Tetbury Councillors as part of their continued misinformation campaign on the project, we thought it would be appropriate to provide an update on the progress we have made since our planning application was submitted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dolphins Recreation Centre AGM</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-06-23-agm2020/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-06-23-agm2020/</guid>
      <description>The Dolphins Hall Management Committee AGM would typically be held sometime between April and June. The public at the AGM would elect six resident trustees to serve until the next AGM, and the trustees present the accounts to those present.
At last years AGM there were nearly one hundred people. Current social distancing rules make holding a meeting of this size impractical. Also, traditional paper-based secret ballots are quite high contact events, which is far from desirable at this time.</description>

      <title>Update on Plot 8</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-06-22-update-on-plot8/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-06-22-update-on-plot8/</guid>
      <description>Since our update in May, discussions around Plot 8 have continued with both the Charity Commission and Tetbury Town Council. The trust’s position remains, as it always has been, that as trustees we have to act in the best interest of the trust, and it’s charitable aims, while also being mindful, if a decision we take can be challenged, we need to be able to provide sufficient evidence to support the outcome.</description>

      <title>Tetbury Town Council Planning Committee</title>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-05-14-ttc-planning/</guid>
      <description>Very sad that tonight Tetbury Town Council&amp;rsquo;s Planning Committee failed to support the Dolphins Hall Redevelopment Project and decided to object to our planning application. Delays to the planning put the project at risk due to time limits on certain funds.
Their concerns on which their objections were based were either factually inaccurate or over points that the trustees had discussed with the Cotswold District Council Planning Officer and Conservation Officers prior to submitting the planning application.</description>

      <title>Plot 8</title>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-05-13-plot-8/</guid>
      <description>At the 2019 AGM, a Tetbury resident raised a query in concerning Plot 8 on the Recreation Ground.
Plot 8 includes the area of the Rec (known by some as the ‘training ground’) for which Tetbury Town Council have applied for an extension of the burial ground at St. Saviour’s church and has long been the subject of much debate.
The query put to us was around the ownership of this plot of land as the planning application submitted by Tetbury Town Council indicated it was the owner of the land.</description>

      <title>New Build Planning Application</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-04-04-planning-permission/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-04-04-planning-permission/</guid>
      <description>Given the current unusual and uncertain world which we find ourselves living in, and one where positive news stories seem hard to come by, we are delighted to announce that yesterday evening, the Dolphins Recreation Centre submitted the full planning application for the Redevelopment Project!
For more information please see the full announcement
There have been many challenges to overcome to get to this point, and it is not an understatement to say the kind words and supportive conversations have been all we’ve had to keep us going at points, so our heartfelt thanks go out to the community of Tetbury.</description>

      <title>Covid-19 Update - Hall Closed Until End of April</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-22-hall-closed/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-22-hall-closed/</guid>
      <description>In light of the amended guidance from the government announced on the 20th March 2020 the trustees have now decided to close the Dolphins Hall until at least the end of April 2020. All bookings at this time will be cancelled and refunded.
The trustees will continue to monitor the government advice and review the closure again if things change.
The sad reality is the closure will probably need to go on beyond this original period.</description>

      <title>Covid-19 Update</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-19-covid-19-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-19-covid-19-update/</guid>
      <description>The trustees have decided that at this time the hall will remain open for bookings. We do not feel it is our place to tell the users of the building if they can or cannot hold their meetings and events. We think it is for each individual and organisation to take the responsibility for making a judgement on what is appropriate at this time. We strongly suggest that people follow the latest government advice and do need to remind people that anyone running or attending an event at the Dolphins Hall does so at their own risk.</description>
