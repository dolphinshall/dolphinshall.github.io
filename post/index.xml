      <description>Given the current unusual and uncertain world which we find ourselves living in, and one where positive news stories seem hard to come by, we are delighted to announce that yesterday evening, the Dolphins Recreation Centre submitted the full planning application for the Redevelopment Project!
For more information please see the full announcement
There have been many challenges to overcome to get to this point, and it is not an understatement to say the kind words and supportive conversations have been all we’ve had to keep us going at points, so our heartfelt thanks go out to the community of Tetbury.</description>

      <title>Covid-19 Update - Hall Closed Until End of April</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-22-hall-closed/</link>

      <guid>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-22-hall-closed/</guid>
      <description>In light of the amended guidance from the government announced on the 20th March 2020 the trustees have now decided to close the Dolphins Hall until at least the end of April 2020. All bookings at this time will be cancelled and refunded.
The trustees will continue to monitor the government advice and review the closure again if things change.
The sad reality is the closure will probably need to go on beyond this original period.</description>

      <title>Covid-19 Update</title>
      <link>https://dolphinshall.org/post/2020-03-19-covid-19-update/</link>

      <description>The trustees have decided that at this time the hall will remain open for bookings. We do not feel it is our place to tell the users of the building if they can or cannot hold their meetings and events. We think it is for each individual and organisation to take the responsibility for making a judgement on what is appropriate at this time. We strongly suggest that people follow the latest government advice and do need to remind people that anyone running or attending an event at the Dolphins Hall does so at their own risk.</description>

      <description>So today we release an update to our website. This new site will allow us to provide more frequent information. Most importantly it now also incorporates and links to a new booking system. The new system will enable you to book the Dolphins Hall online and pay using your credit or debit card. The system has only just been configured so there may be a glitch here and there. If you try to book and something goes wrong, please do get in touch here and let us know and we will sort it out as quickly as we can.</description>
