    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Since our <a href="/post/2020-05-13-plot-8/">update in May</a>, discussions around Plot 8 have continued with both the Charity Commission and Tetbury Town Council. The trust’s position remains, as it always has been, that as trustees we have to act in the best interest of the trust, and it’s charitable aims, while also being mindful, if a decision we take can be challenged, we need to be able to provide sufficient evidence to support the outcome.</p>
<p><em>Plot 8 includes the area of the Rec (known by some as the ‘training ground’) for which Tetbury Town Council have applied for an extension of the burial ground at St. Saviour’s church and has long been the subject of much debate.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the position remains unresolved, but irrespective of any feelings or emotions from anyone involved in the discussions, it is important they follow the correct process and the outcome is based on the evidence available.</p>
<p>The trust’s position is based on the documentation, which both parties hold, which confirms:</p>
<p>• Plot 8 was purchased by the original charity in 1925, and the title deeds for the land are held by the trust;</p>
<p>• When the charities were restructured in 1973, the Charity Order issued by the Charity Commission confirmed Plot 8 was held in trust, and the 1974 conveyance also states that all land noted in the 1973 Order was to be held in trust by the new charity;</p>
<p>• If at any point post-1973 the land was transferred away from the trust, the Charity Commission would have had to issue a further Charity Order and sign off on the transaction. No such order can be located;</p>
<p>• Tetbury Town Council have never listed Plot 8 within their asset register as an asset they own and can find no purchase records or deeds confirming the transfer of the land to them.</p>
<p><strong>We are though committed to attempting to resolve the position with the Council and have agreed to enter into talks to see whether a solution can be found to resolve the matter and avoid any unnecessary legal action.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These talks are a positive step forward and are due to start shortly with a small group containing representatives from both parties.</strong></p>
