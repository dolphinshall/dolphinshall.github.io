      We thought you may all like a sneak peak at some of the images of a model based on the design of the new Community, Youth &amp; Sports Complex which we&rsquo;ve received from the architects recently as it certainly made us excited and gave us a boost following all the recent drama around the project!
While we still wait for the release of the S106 monies for the project, we&rsquo;re continuing to take the project seriously and getting ready to start the build as soon as planning permission is received.

      We want to thank our District Councillors, Stephen Hirst, Nikki Ind and Richard Norris for organising a meeting today between representatives from the Dolphins Recreation Centre (DRC), Cotswold District Council (CDC) Planning, CDC Legal and Tetbury Town Council (the Mayor and the Town Clerk).
The purpose of the meeting was to examine some of the Town Council&rsquo;s concerns over their individual liability and S106 compliance in respect of Project One of the DRC Redevelopment Project.

We are very sad however that tonight Tetbury Town Council refused to release the S106 monies assigned to the new Dolphins Redevelopment Project and yet again, the possibility of new community facilities from Tetbury takes another step back.

Tonight Tetbury Town Council planning committee took the opportunity to once again review the plans for the Redevelopment Project and voted unanimously to withdraw their objection and now support the project. This means all statutory bodies now support the project and we await final sign off from Cotswold District Council which is due by the end of the month.

After years of neglect, we started work last year on improving the upkeep and maintenance of the Recreation Ground. The eagle eyed among you will have noticed the work we started last week to improve the facilities enjoyed by everyone out on the Recreation Ground.

      The Dolphins Hall Management Committee AGM would typically be held sometime between April and June. The public at the AGM would elect six resident trustees to serve until the next AGM, and the trustees present the accounts to those present.
At last years AGM there were nearly one hundred people. Current social distancing rules make holding a meeting of this size impractical. Also, traditional paper-based secret ballots are quite high contact events, which is far from desirable at this time.

      Very sad that tonight Tetbury Town Council&rsquo;s Planning Committee failed to support the Dolphins Hall Redevelopment Project and decided to object to our planning application. Delays to the planning put the project at risk due to time limits on certain funds.
Their concerns on which their objections were based were either factually inaccurate or over points that the trustees had discussed with the Cotswold District Council Planning Officer and Conservation Officers prior to submitting the planning application.

      At the 2019 AGM, a Tetbury resident raised a query in concerning Plot 8 on the Recreation Ground.
Plot 8 includes the area of the Rec (known by some as the ‘training ground’) for which Tetbury Town Council have applied for an extension of the burial ground at St. Saviour’s church and has long been the subject of much debate.
The query put to us was around the ownership of this plot of land as the planning application submitted by Tetbury Town Council indicated it was the owner of the land.

      In light of the amended guidance from the government announced on the 20th March 2020 the trustees have now decided to close the Dolphins Hall until at least the end of April 2020. All bookings at this time will be cancelled and refunded.
The trustees will continue to monitor the government advice and review the closure again if things change.
The sad reality is the closure will probably need to go on beyond this original period.
