      Introduction This has been a strange year. COVID-19 has stopped almost everything the trust normally does, yet the trustees have possibly been the busiest we have ever been. Not having to focus on the day-to-day activities of running the hall has allowed time for the trustees to correct and put in place some of the things that have been allowed to slip in the past. That means, as we now reach the end of our financial year and move into the next, we do so in a stronger, and maybe more organised position, than the trust has ever been in.

      Even though the Dolphins Hall is closed, and most sports cancelled it has still been a busy time for the Dolphins Recreation Centre trustees as we catch up with a lot of quite boring, but very important, administrative tasks that have fallen behind over the years. Hopefully by time life gets back too normal the trust will be in far better shape than it has been for many, many years.

      Since the 29th June 2020, the Dolphins Recreation Centre have been attempting to work with Tetbury Town Council to allow for the forwarding of the S106 funding which the Council holds for the purposes of improving the existing facilities at the Dolphins Hall and Recreation Ground.
You will have noticed that for the last three months we have made no public announcements on how this process was going in order to allow these discussions to take their course without any social media storm upsetting them or impacting progress.

      Following the Mayor confirming on Friday 18th December that there was no way for the Council to take action this year to forward the S106 funding (despite over £500,000 being sat in the Town Council&rsquo;s bank account), the trustees prepared and agreed the content of the attached letter which was sent to all councillors on Monday. It was also distributed to Cotswold District Council, Gloucestershire County Council and our local MP.

      Despite the lights shining out around Tetbury as the community embraces the call for a Christmas lights trail, it has not been a period of Christmas cheer for the trustees of the Dolphins Recreation Centre.
On 23rd October 2020, TTC confirmed one of the S106 contracts awarded to us by CDC would be released, with the remaining two to be voted on within a week. 56 days later, no funds have materialised and despite our requests, this wasn’t even an agenda item at the Council meeting on Monday 14th December.

      As you know on Thursday evening, the Dolphins Recreation Centre (DRC) and Tetbury Town Council (TTC) held two small face-to-face meetings arranged by the Chair of the Redevelopment Project in an attempt to move discussions forward and put them on a more positive footing to hopefully see the S106 funding released.
Both parties have agreed to keep the contents of the discussions private, however at the meeting TTC did ask for a correction to the leaflet recently produced by DRC which was funded and distributed by a small number of our supporters also hoping to see the project start ASAP.

However, to date, we have not received an official complaint from any members of Tetbury Town Council and their public statement is, in fact, the first time we have heard about it.

      This week we have seen the installation of the new playground equipment completed and it’s looking great!
At a cost of over £4,000 it is a significant investment for us and one we couldn’t have made without the £1,500 kindly donated by Tetbury Lions and which are extremely thankful for.
The playground is a key part of the facility for us, but it a costly one to upkeep and one which the original maintenance plans agreed at installation have been long forgotten.
