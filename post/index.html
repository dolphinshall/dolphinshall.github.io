        The Dolphins Recreation Centre AGM

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The Dolphins Hall Management Committee AGM would typically be held sometime between April and June. The public at the AGM would elect six resident trustees to serve until the next AGM, and the trustees present the accounts to those present.
At last years AGM there were nearly one hundred people. Current social distancing rules make holding a meeting of this size impractical. Also, traditional paper-based secret ballots are quite high contact events, which is far from desirable at this time.

      Since our update in May, discussions around Plot 8 have continued with both the Charity Commission and Tetbury Town Council. The trust’s position remains, as it always has been, that as trustees we have to act in the best interest of the trust, and it’s charitable aims, while also being mindful, if a decision we take can be challenged, we need to be able to provide sufficient evidence to support the outcome.

      Very sad that tonight Tetbury Town Council&rsquo;s Planning Committee failed to support the Dolphins Hall Redevelopment Project and decided to object to our planning application. Delays to the planning put the project at risk due to time limits on certain funds.
Their concerns on which their objections were based were either factually inaccurate or over points that the trustees had discussed with the Cotswold District Council Planning Officer and Conservation Officers prior to submitting the planning application.

      At the 2019 AGM, a Tetbury resident raised a query in concerning Plot 8 on the Recreation Ground.
Plot 8 includes the area of the Rec (known by some as the ‘training ground’) for which Tetbury Town Council have applied for an extension of the burial ground at St. Saviour’s church and has long been the subject of much debate.
The query put to us was around the ownership of this plot of land as the planning application submitted by Tetbury Town Council indicated it was the owner of the land.

There have been many challenges to overcome to get to this point, and it is not an understatement to say the kind words and supportive conversations have been all we’ve had to keep us going at points, so our heartfelt thanks go out to the community of Tetbury.

        Covid-19 Update - Hall Closed Until End of April

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In light of the amended guidance from the government announced on the 20th March 2020 the trustees have now decided to close the Dolphins Hall until at least the end of April 2020. All bookings at this time will be cancelled and refunded.
The trustees will continue to monitor the government advice and review the closure again if things change.
The sad reality is the closure will probably need to go on beyond this original period.

      The trustees have decided that at this time the hall will remain open for bookings. We do not feel it is our place to tell the users of the building if they can or cannot hold their meetings and events. We think it is for each individual and organisation to take the responsibility for making a judgement on what is appropriate at this time. We strongly suggest that people follow the latest government advice and do need to remind people that anyone running or attending an event at the Dolphins Hall does so at their own risk.
