    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Even though the Dolphins Hall is closed, and most sports cancelled it has still been a
busy time for the Dolphins Recreation Centre trustees as we catch up with a lot of
quite boring, but very important, administrative tasks that have fallen behind over the
years. Hopefully by time life gets back too normal the trust will be in far better
shape than it has been for many, many years.</p>
<p><strong>The Hall:</strong> We hope to being reopening the hall for limited activities in mid-April as
allowed by government guidelines. Over the coming months we should be able to
start welcoming back more of our regulars and hopefully by end of the summer we
will be allowed to open for normal bookings and maybe even a party or two.</p>
<p><strong>The Redevelopment Project:</strong> As I write this, in early March, we are still trying to obtain the
S106 funding that has been allocated to the project from Tetbury Town Council. This has
turned into a long, complex and sometimes confrontational process that is far too complex
to try and explain here. Hopefully by time you read this the issues will have been resolved
and we will be pushing on with the project. If they haven’t … well that would have sad
consequences for the town. To keep up to date with redevelopment project new
please either visit our Facebook page or website at <a href="https://dolphinshall.org">dolphinshall.org</a></p>
<p><strong>The Rec:</strong> As we come into April, we will be continuing with our next round of works
to improve the ground. After many years of missing out on proper maintenance the
ground will getting some TLC.</p>
<p><strong>Play area:</strong> Our current play area is old and very tired. We have decided to try give
the play area a much needed make over and so we have approached a company to
come up with some designs for us. We are still in the process of getting these ready
to show to the community, but we are excited to share them and look forward to
receiving feedback. Installing a play area is an incredibly costly job and as the
playpark and rec has no income, we will be needing to raise funds for the project. If
anyone is interested in giving their feedback or help with fundraising please contact
us at contact@dolphinshall.org.</p>
<p>As the evenings get a little lighter and the weather gets a little better maybe on a Thursday
evening you might fancy wandering up to the rec for a, properly socially distanced, evening
walk and then pick up a pizza from the Garden Kitchen Pizza Co who’s van will be serving
pizza between 5pm and 8pm in the recreation ground Hampton Street car park.</p>
