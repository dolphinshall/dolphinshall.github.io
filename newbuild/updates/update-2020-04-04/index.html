    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>We are delighted to announce that yesterday evening, 3rd April 2020, the Dolphins Recreation Centre submitted the full planning application for the Redevelopment Project!</p>
<p>This marks the end of a challenging and detailed design and review process, spanning almost eighteen months, and which has involved five public consultation events and two online surveys. We’ve had plenty of feedback which we have incorporated into our thinking, so we are hopeful we have listened and got this right! For those of you who may not be as familiar as others with the project, the proposal is to develop two new community buildings – firstly a Youth &amp; Sports Complex and secondly a new Community Hall. The development will see the delivery of new modern facilities for the local community and finally bring about a long overdue improvement in the facilities available to the people of Tetbury.</p>
<p>As has been our aim since taking over the project, we want the process to be open and transparent, so please do continue to provide us with any feedback you do have, by emailing <a href="mailto:projectchair@dolphinshall.org">projectchair@dolphinshall.org</a>. In keeping with these values, we would also like to share with you the Design &amp; Access Statement (<a href="/images/posts/Update-2020-04-04/Dolphins_Hall_Design_Statement.pdf">click here</a>) which provides all the detailed background to the consultation we have undertaken, how the designs have developed and the rationale for the decisions which we have taken. It also includes a copy of the final plans which have been submitted. We will warn you though, it is a 60+ page document, but at least in the current lockdown it might provide some light relief for some of you! The drawing documents can also be found at the bottom of this announcement.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud to have got to this position given the challenges which have previously been linked to this project and not least that we have done it with the overwhelming support of the local community (remember our final public consultation got an 100% approval rating!). We would therefore also like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who has taken the time to provide feedback, give us their backing and written letters of support for the project. There have been many challenges to overcome to get to this point, and it is not an understatement to say the kind words and supportive conversations have been all we’ve had to keep us going at points, so our heartfelt thanks go out to the community of Tetbury. Our intention is very much to deliver the facilities which you have asked us for and which we feel you absolutely deserve.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning though, and we would encourage everyone who has helped us get to this point to take the time to register their support of the planning application when it goes live on the Cotswold District Council Planning portal and we will provide the details for this as soon as we have them.</p>
<p>Stay safe everyone, keep smiling and hopefully the approval of our planning application can be another positive news story we can share with you all in the upcoming weeks.</p>
