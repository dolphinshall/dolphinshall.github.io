    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>We’ve been busy analysing the answers you provided in our recent survey to determine a plan for the redevelopment of the Dolphin’s Hall and we’re pleased to confirm we are now in a position where we can share our plan with you.</p>
<p>Progress has been slower than we would have liked, but in a development of this size and with multiple user group requirements to consider, there is no quick win and no easy solution. We have spent time understanding our users, our neighbours and our community. We have spent time understanding our charitable and legal obligations, as well as our financial position and the mistakes made historically which have seen the project falter . This has been important activity as we wanted to ensure at the point we were able to share our vision with had considered everything which could impact the success of the development.</p>
<p>Having taken the last few months to really understand all of this, we would like to share our thoughts and aspirations for the site. The plans are contained within the link below and show our plan to provide the community with modern facilities at the Dolphins Hall and enable us to provide a much improved Dolphins Hall and Recreation Ground:</p>
<p><a href="/downloads/newbuild/updates/2018-12-04/480DH_Public-consulation-report_061218.pdf">View Proposal</a></p>
<p>In addition to this, we are launching the next stage of our public consultation and this will form another online survey (found here), supported by a number of public drop in sessions, the first of which will be at the Dolphins Hall on Sunday 9th December, which we will be running between 10.30 – 4.00. These will be open sessions and will give you the opportunity to talk 1:1 with trustees, ask any questions you have and provide any feedback you have on the redevelopment proposal.</p>
<p>We appreciate this is short notice, but we have always said as soon as we are in a position to share with you, we would and now is that time.  If you are unable to make this drop in session, do not worry, as more will follow and you do of course also have the online survey.</p>
<p>We feel the solution we have come up with is an efficient use of the space and more importantly, provides us with a business plan which will see the trust able to be sustainable and ultimately profitable, in a way which it hasn’t been for a number of years. The redevelopment of the site will take place over a number of phases to provide the community with two new community spaces, as well as almost doubling the parking capacity of the site.</p>
<p>Importantly too, the phased nature of the design means no user group is without a facility until a new one is built for them, meaning we can keep providing a home and a space for all our user groups during the development, and even better, we can also re-open the hall immediately too.</p>
<p>As this stage of the project progresses, we will also publish a list of the most frequently asked questions and further detail as and when we have it. The current trustees are committed to engaging with you at regular intervals and we want to ensure this process continues with the level of transparency which we have shown from the start.</p>
<p>We hope we will gain the support of the community for this initiative and that today can mark the day when the whole community can begin working together to see the redevelopment plan move forward and enable us to provide the people of Tetbury with the standard of facility which you all very much deserve.
